# quest-2-link-fix

A case study for Meta's Link utilities shortcomings.

Oculus Link shares great fault in communication between a native Windows system and its Android operating system. Such faults include:

* Crashing on startup
* Not providing sound between either client
* Abruptly ending the session between either system
* Crashing the Quest 2's entire operating system, thus causing a reboot
etc. etc.

### This is an issue in the Quest 2's guardian system.
